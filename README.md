# Chess Game with AI

## Overview
This project is a simplified chess game implemented in Python. It features basic move generation, game state evaluation, and an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

## Features
- **Board Representation & Evaluation:** Uses predefined piece values for evaluation.
- **Move Generation:** Implements logic for all chess pieces.
- **Game Rules Enforcement:** Detects check, checkmate, and stalemate.
- **AI Opponent:** Uses Minimax with alpha-beta pruning for move selection.
- **User Interaction:** Supports human vs AI gameplay.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ramisbeige/AIprojs
   cd chess-game
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if required):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python chess.py
   ```

## Usage
- The game runs in a terminal interface.
- Players take turns making moves.
- The AI calculates optimal moves using Minimax.
- The game announces checkmate or stalemate when the game ends.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- Improve AI evaluation for stronger gameplay.
- Develop a graphical interface for better user experience.
